,,I cannot find anything good to say,There are many issues.,There are some issues.,Everything is fine. I cannot find any faults.,This is perfection embodied
Code is well documented and readable,10,1,2,3,4,5
,,The approaches seem inefficient overall,The approaches seem largely ineffificent.,The approaches are largely efficient with some room for improvement.,Everything is fine. I cannot find any faults.,The solutions are exceptionally well done
The problems are solved well,10,1,2,3,4,5
